Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s extremely busy world. People are always short on time with the myriad tasks they need to accomplish in the limited 24 hours. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.

The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual. These results are based on their profile, search/browsing history, what other people with similar traits/demographics are watching, and how likely are you to watch those movies. This is achieved through predictive modeling and heuristics with the data available.

# Types of Recommendation System :

 1 : Collaborative Filtering:
 
Collaborative filtering evaluates user interactions and identifies similarities between people (user-based) or items (item-based).
User-based collaborative filtering predicts items a user might appreciate based on ratings given by other users with similar preferences.
For example, if User A and User B like the same movies, User A may enjoy other movies that User B likes.

2 : Content-Based Filtering:

Content-based filtering recommends items based on their attributes and features.
It analyzes the content of items (e.g., movie genres, product descriptions) and suggests similar items to those a user has shown interest in.
For instance, if a user enjoys action movies, the system recommends other action movies based on shared characteristics.

3 : Hybrid Systems:

Hybrid recommendation systems combine collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
These systems leverage the strengths of both approaches to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations.
By blending user preferences and item features, hybrid systems enhance the overall recommendation quality.
